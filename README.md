# TinDog

TinDog website built for the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.

To view, go to: https://lucasantonsen.github.io.

Website uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5. Original template files can be found here: https://github.com/londonappbrewery/TinDog-Start.

Dr. Yu provided the basic content for the website in index.html and /images. I implemented the necessary HTML elements, created the CSS stylesheet, and added the Bootstrap 5 components to create the TinDog website.
